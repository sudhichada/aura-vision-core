Aura Vision Agent Constitution
Project Goal: E-commerce room visualization with real-time style tuning.
Frontend Stack: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for slider interactions).
Backend Stack: Python (FastAPI) on Google Cloud Run.
AI/ML Stack: Vertex AI Model Garden (Stable Diffusion XL, ControlNet, SAM).
Database: Firebase (Firestore for users, Vector Search for style tags).
Coding Standards: Functional components, strict TypeScript, Jest for testing.

New Capability: The system must support 'Product Inpainting'. Users will select a furniture item (image URL), and the backend must use a Mask-aware diffusion model to insert that specific item into the room while preserving lighting
